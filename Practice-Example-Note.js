// This is a simple number guessing game where the user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 10. The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number, which is 7 in this case. Once the correct number is guessed, a congratulatory message is displayed.   
// The game demonstrates the use of a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until a specific condition is met (i.e., the correct number is guessed). This showcases how loops can be effectively used in interactive applications to manage user input and control program flow.
