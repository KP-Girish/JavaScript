//what is alert and prompt in JavaScript?
//Alert and Prompt are built-in functions in JavaScript used to interact with users through dialog boxes.
//Alert is used to display a message to the user. It shows a simple dialog box with an OK button. The user can only acknowledge the message by clicking the OK button.
alert("This is an alert message!");
//Prompt is used to get input from the user. It shows a dialog box with a message, an input field, and OK and Cancel buttons. The user can enter a value in the input field and click OK to submit it or Cancel to dismiss the dialog.
let userInput = prompt("Please enter your name:");
if (userInput !== null) {
    console.log("Hello, " + userInput + "!");
} else {
    console.log("User cancelled the prompt.");
}
//In this example, if the user enters their name and clicks OK, a greeting message is logged to the console. If the user clicks Cancel, a cancellation message is logged.
//Alert and Prompt are useful for simple interactions, but they can be intrusive as they block the execution of the code until the user responds. For more complex interactions, consider using custom modal dialogs created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
//Overall, Alert and Prompt are straightforward ways to communicate with users in a web application.    
//They are easy to implement and require no additional libraries or frameworks.
//However, they should be used sparingly to avoid disrupting the user experience.
//In modern web development, it's often better to use custom dialog boxes for a more seamless and integrated user experience.
//Alert and Prompt are part of the Window interface in JavaScript and are supported by all major web browsers.
//They are widely used in various web applications for quick notifications and user input.
